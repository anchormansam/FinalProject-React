### BangAChain Build a Bag! 

### Sprint #1

Start Date: 11/18/2019
End Date: 12/4/2019

### Details

The current sprint was to build a feature for websites as a possible plugin or standalone web-app. Users are able to create an account so that they may track disc that they bag. Users may have multiples just in case a user uses a different bag to 
practice with then a bag they would compete with. As a user they will also be allowed to delete disc out of their bag or delete the bag entirely.

### Current Issues

- Once a user logouts of their account they are not automaticly returned to the home screen. They are stuck viewing the         current view unless they hit the BangAChain logo on the top left of the site. 

- Styling is an issue as all devices currently do not have a fluid view of all features. This means mobile users have a more
  compressed view and there is a lot of data on the screen. It currently looks better on desktop view however when viewing 
  a users bag and disc that is in it looks fine.

### Future Site Goals

The plan is to make this site a full featured ecommerce site. This will allow the client to sell disc online as well as 
at his establishment. Users will be able to see what disc they need for their bag then shop with the retailer to get a better
understanding of what disc they need for their bag. The client would love to see his site be used to pupblish live streams that users would pay a subscription fee to see.
